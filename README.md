# DiscordBerry

This is a project I am working on as of now. This is a Dicord bot built with the 
**discord.py** API. A personal project that I expect to expand on its 
functionality later on.

## Dependencies

1. **discord.py API**
2. **python3.4**
3. **asyncio**

### Commands

There are a few commands that I have made for this bot (some of them are still
in development). 

```
!commands, !doc, !fight, !echo
```
